Stack: 
  A stack is a collection of objects inserted and removed according to Last-In-First-Out principle

The stack abstract data type supports: 
  1. push(e)
  2. pop()
  3. peek()
  4. is_empty()
  5. len(s) 


We can use a python list as an underlying data structure to create a stack. 
To do this we will use a common technique called a adapter pattern. 

def. The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.
