const findFiveLargestNumbers = (numbers) => {
    
    let largestNumbers = [];
    
    // make an array that is gonna be are return array, we push each "max" to that arary. 
    for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        let max = -Infinity
        
        for(let j = 1; j < numbers.length; j++){    
            if(numbers[j] > max && !largestNumbers.includes(numbers[j])){
                    max = numbers[j]
                }
            }
        
            largestNumbers.push(max);
    }

    return largestNumbers;
}

The run time of my function above is O(n)
This is because the outer loop runs at a fixed constant rate (5). 
The loop inside runs depending on the length of the input. (length of the array)
So basically, O(5 * n)
We drop the constants leaving O(n).
